# A Literary Spark: Using GPT-4 and Midjourney to Visualize Literature

This repository contains the source code, data, and resources for the project "A Literary Spark: Using GPT-4 and Midjourney to Visualize Literature." The goal of this project is to explore the potential of state-of-the-art language and image synthesis models like GPT-4 in interpreting and visualizing literary works as their authors may have pictured them.

## Introduction
This project was inspired by Microsoft's 400-page paper claiming OpenAI's GPT-4 may have "a spark of artificial general intelligence." The research project aims to explore the capabilities of large-language and image synthesis models like GPT-4 in interpreting and visualizing literary works as their authors may have pictured them.

## Methodology
The methodology involved selecting five classic novels and identifying key locations within each book. Then, GPT-4 was used to generate a series of textual prompts describing these locations. Finally, the prompts were used with the Midjourney v5 image synthesis model to generate visual representations of the literary locations.

A complete step-by-step guide on the methodology can be found in the `Methodology.md` file in this repository.

## Results
The results folder contains images generated by Midjourney v5 for each of the locations in the selected novels. These images provide a visual representation of the locations as they might have been imagined by their authors.

## Discussion
In this project, the limitations observed were more on Midjourney's side than GPT-4's. GPT-4 showed strong capabilities in generating and modifying prompts as needed, while Midjourney seemed less flexible. This research offers future directions for the evaluation of image synthesis models and multi-modal models using an unbiased prompt generator.
