# Igniting Imagination: GPT-4 and Midjourney's Venture into Literary Visualization

This repository contains the prompts, and resources for the project "Igniting Imagination: GPT-4 and Midjourney's Venture into Literary Visualization." The goal of this project is to explore the potential of state-of-the-art language and image synthesis models like GPT-4 in interpreting and visualizing literary works as their authors may have pictured them. Critically, this lead to the development of a one-shot prompt that "teaches" GPT-4 to effectively generate and modify prompts for Midjourney v5 and v5.1. This prompt could serve as a framework to test the capabilities of text-to-image models. By integrating this innovative prompt, it’s possible to explore the potential for combining GPT-4's capabilities with existing image synthesis models like Midjourney to create more accurate and detailed visualizations.

## Introduction
This project was inspired by Microsoft's 400-page paper claiming OpenAI's GPT-4 may have "a spark of artificial general intelligence." The research project aims to explore the capabilities of large-language and image synthesis models in interpreting and visualizing literary works as their authors may have pictured them.

## Methodology
The methodology involved selecting five classic novels and identifying key locations within each book. Then, GPT-4 was used to generate a series of textual prompts describing these locations. Finally, the prompts were used with the Midjourney v5 image synthesis model to generate visual representations of the literary locations without any references to the authors, book titles or fictional location names.

A complete step-by-step guide on the methodology can be found in the `Methodology.md` file in this repository.

## Results
The results folder contains the final prompts along with the images generated by Midjourney v5 for each of the locations in the selected novels. These images provide a visual representation of the locations as they might have been imagined by their authors.

## Discussion
In this project, the limitations observed were more on Midjourney's side than GPT-4's. GPT-4 showed strong capabilities in generating and modifying prompts as needed, while Midjourney seemed less flexible. This research offers future directions for the evaluation of image synthesis models and multi-modal models using an unbiased prompt generator.

**Midjourney v5.1 was released on the final day this project was due. Using the same prompts, some images generated with 5.1 seemed more technically impressive but were not necessarily always better. Although 5.1 seemed to have better "inferential capabalities" with shorter, low-detail prompts, GPT-4's detailed prompts were still more effective. This may indicate the strength of the Midjourney “Teaching” Prompt, as the newest prompt version seemed to increase image generation quality substantially more than the upgrade from v5 to 5.1. Given more time, this showcases an example of how it's possible to compare different models and versions in a more nuanced manner. Many of the limitations that v5 seemed to have still prevail in 5.1, thus I did not feel the need to update the images.
