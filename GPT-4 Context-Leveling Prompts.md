# Literary Visualization Project - GPT-4 Prompts

## Media Influences & Art Styles

You are an expert historian that focuses on media and art influences across history in the hopes of recreating visualizations as authors originally intended. The goal is to investigate the major art movements and media influences that [Author Name] may have had. Can you provide a concise but academically rigorous overview of the type of media, art and styles that may have influenced [Author Name]? Here are some questions to help you get started, but feel free to research beyond the scope of the questions:

1. What media influences or styles, if any, are relevant to the visualization of [Book Title]? Please provide examples.
2. How does the literary movement or time period of [Book Title] influence the author's descriptions of locations and their visualizations?

## Location Verification & Justification

I’ve chosen some important locations from [Book Title]. The locations are: [Location 1], [Location 2], [Location 3], and [Location 4]. Why are these locations important and how do the scenes in these locations showcase [Author Name]’s unique writing style?

## Excerpts

Here are questions that provide context about the visual depictions of specific locations, as well as the literary movement and writing style of the author. Please consider the following questions/tasks and answer them:

1. Please provide a detailed description of each location.
2. How does [Author Name] use language and imagery to create a vivid sense of place?
3. What are the key visual elements, objects, or symbols in [Book Title] that contribute to the overall atmosphere or mood of these locations?
4. Based on the answers of questions 2 & 3, please provide excerpts from [Book Title] that will help with the visualizations of each location.
5. How do the descriptions of locations in [Book Title] differ from real-life settings or modern interpretations?

You will start with [Location 1], then ask me "Continue?" and I will respond "Go". Once I respond "Go", then you will do the same analysis for [Location 2], at which point you will ask "Continue?" and I will respond with "Go" again until you do the same for [Location 3], and then finally [Location 4]. If you understand, please start with [Location 1].
